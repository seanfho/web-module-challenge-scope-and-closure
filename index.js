/*Task 1: counterMaker()
  
  Study the code for counter1 and counter2, then answer the questions below.
  
  1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?

    There are several differences between counter1 and counter2. counter1 is a function expression and can be invoked by using the variable name (ie. counter1() - *note that calling/invoking counterMaker() will return the function counter() and not the count value) only after it has been initialized. counter2 is defined using a function declaration and so is necessarily hoisted (ie. it can be invoked before it is declared - *note that counter2() will throw an error if invoked before the global variable "count" is declared since counter2 uses "count" and "count" is a "let" variable and so therefore not hoisted). counter1 uses a local variable "count" and a nested function "counter()" to achieve it's functionality(ie. keeping a count of how many times the function has been called) via a closure (counter() searches and finds the count variable in its parent function counterMaker()). counter1 has the "private" variable of count that is protected by the scope of the counterMaker() function and can only be changed by invoking counter1 (Note* counterMaker() runs only once, initializes the count variable (set to 0) and then the inner function counter() is returned and assigned to "counter1". Now the inner function, counter(), has reference to the original count object each time counter1 is invoked allowing the "count" to persist from one call to the next). counter2 increments the global variable count which, at any point in the program, could have its value updated, however it functions identically to counter1 otherwise.    

  2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?

    counter1 uses a closure. The nested function "counter()" must return the current "count" plus 1 but does not have a count variable in it's local scope. The counter() function must look to it's parent function for "count" is able to find and use it. This is a closure.

  
  3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better?

    counter1 would be preferable in situations where you the count should only be affected by a single function. This ensures that no matter where in the program/code the function is invoked one can be sure that they are recieving an accurate count. counter2 may be preferable if multiple functions or blocks of code are keeping a cumulative count of something and all need access to the same "count". With that being said, I believe it is better practice to keep variables local when possible, and there could be better ways to keep a cumulative count of specific actions than to use a counter in the form of counter2.

// counter1 code
function counterMaker() {
  let count = 0;

/* ⚾️⚾️⚾️ Task 2: inning() ⚾️⚾️⚾️
Use the inning function below to do the following:
  1. Return a random whole number of points between 0 and 2 scored by one team in an inning
  
  For example: invoking inning() should return a numerical score value of 0, 1, or 2
  
NOTE: This will be a callback function for the tasks below
*/

function inning(/*Code Here*/){
    /*Code Here*/
}


/* ⚾️⚾️⚾️ Task 3: finalScore() ⚾️⚾️⚾️
Use the finalScore function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `inning` that was created in Task 2 
  2. Receive a number of innings to be played
  3. After each inning, update the score of the home and away teams
  4. After the last inning, return an object containing the final (total) score of the innings played
  
  For example: invoking finalScore(inning, 9) might return this object:
{
  "Home": 11,
  "Away": 5
}
*/ 

function finalScore(/*code Here*/){
  /*Code Here*/
}

/* ⚾️⚾️⚾️ Task 4: getInningScore() ⚾️⚾️⚾️
Use the getInningScore() function below to do the following:
  1. Receive a callback function - you will pass in the inning function from task 2 as your argument 
  2. Return an object with a score for home and a score for away that populates from invoking the inning callback function */

function getInningScore(/*Your Code Here */) {
  /*Your Code Here */
}


/* ⚾️⚾️⚾️ Task 5: scoreboard() ⚾️⚾️⚾️
Use the scoreboard function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `getInningScore` from Task 4
  2. Receive the callback function `inning` from Task 2
  3. Receive a number of innings to be played
  4. Return an array where each of it's index values equals a string stating the
  Home and Away team's scores for each inning.  Not the cummulative score.
  5. If there's a tie at the end of the innings, add this message containing the score to the end of the array:  "This game will require extra innings: Away 12 - Home 12"  (see tie example below)
     If there isn't a tie, add this message to the end of the array: "Final Score: Away 13 - Home 11"  (see no tie example below)
  
  NO TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
[
  "Inning 1: Away 1 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 1",
  "Inning 3: Away 0 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 4: Away 2 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 5: Away 2 - Home 0", 
  "Inning 6: Away 1 - Home 1", 
  "Inning 7: Away 0 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 8: Away 2 - Home 2",
  "Inning 9: Away 1 - Home 0", 
  "Final Score: Away 11 - Home 12"  
]

  TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
[
  "Inning 1: Away 1 - Home 1", 
  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 2",
  "Inning 3: Away 1 - Home 0", 
  "Inning 4: Away 1 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 5: Away 0 - Home 0", 
  "Inning 6: Away 2 - Home 1", 
  "Inning 7: Away 0 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 8: Away 2 - Home 1",
  "Inning 9: Away 1 - Home 1", 
  "This game will require extra innings: Away 10 - Home 10"
